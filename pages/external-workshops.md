### Data science

Data visualization plays an essential role in the representation of both small and large-scale datasets. "A picture is worth a thousand words". It especially applies when trying to explain the insight obtained from the analysis of increasingly large datasets. Data scientist are able to tell a compelling story, visualizing data and findings in an approachable and stimulating way.

The main goal of this Data Visualization with Python workshop is to provide you the opportunity to learn how to take data and present that data in a standardized form. Various techniques have been developed for presenting data visually but we will be focusing on using several data visualization libraries in Python, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.

This workshop jointly organised with Code for Asia will be held on:

* **Date**: Saturday, 12 October 2019
* **Time**: 10:00 – 18:00 (inclusive of 1 hour break)
* **Venue**: Seminar Room **3** (COM1 02-12), School of Computing

**Note: Please bring along your own laptop for this workshop!**

### Web development

Being one of the most prominent skills required in the 21st century, web development is a powerful tool to help you to increase product knowledge, maintain communication between you and potential clients, sell your products or services, increase the popularity of your company and much more. Moreover, web development provides you the opportunity to express yourself creatively on the internet while exploring different possibilities available online.

### Microsoft Excel VBA

Macros allow users to record a set of actions in Microsoft Excel and repeating them dynamically on any cell or sheet. But have you ever wondered what does on behind recording a macro in Microsoft Excel?

Upon opening up your macro, you'll find yourself exposed to the world of Visual Basics for Applications (VBA). VBA is the main programming language used in various Microsoft Office applications such as Word and Excel. It allows users to create and program custom scripts that can be executed through the click of a button or even during the opening of a spreadsheet. Actions that could have never been carried out through basic software functions.

As such, many businesses make use of this powerful tool to create custom applications such as automating the generation of reports, creating custom forms and compiling copious amounts of data.

A glimpse of the topics that will covered include:

* Defining Variables
* Creating Forms
* Message Boxes/Alerts
* Activecell usage
* Conditional Statements

The workshop jointly organised with Acadia Training will be held at:

* **Date**: Tuesday, 25 February 2020
* **Time**: 10:00 – 17:00 (inclusive of 1 hour break; lunch will be provided)
