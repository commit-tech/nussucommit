We operate two computer centres within the NUS Kent Ridge Campus, at the Yusof Ishak House and also at Blk AS8.

![Our Computer Centres at YIH and AS8]({{site.baseurl}}/images/services.jpg)

In YIH, we provide a total of 45 PCs in two clusters equipped with internet access, printing and scanning. To date, we are still the sole provider of public scanning services in NUS.

In AS8, we have more than 44 PCs there, with internet access and printing.
