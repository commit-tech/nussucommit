In NUSSU commIT, we strongly encourage our members to be actively involved in external projects and take on leadership roles. Each year, NUSSU commIT organizes three major projects, namely Cyberia Camp, CharITeach and CREATION.

### Cyberia Camp

This is a 3-day-2-night intensive learning camp where we impart IT skills in a fun and interactive camp setting. Our Adobe software trainings are conducted by IT training professionals during the term break in December. Upon completing the camp, every participant will receive an official training certificate.

Cyberia Camp aims to raise the infocomm and technological knowledge of the general NUS student population. At the end of the camp, participants are expected to have basic proficiency in applications of the software. On top of being a training camp, students just wanna have fun, don’t we? Cyberia Camp synthesises the fun aspects of a camp, the joy of making new friends and a fruitful learning environment to create a truly memorable camp.

Registration for Cyberia Camp usually opens in Semester 1 around October. Stay tuned to our announcements around campus, or [click here]({{site.baseurl}}/events/cyberia/) for more information.

### CREATION

CREATION is a digital design competition organized by Committee of Information and Technology. This competition is open to all NUS students, who create artworks by using any IT softwares such as Photoshop and Illustrator. The winners will be given amazing prizes from our partners.

The aim of this project is to provide a platform for NUS students to apply their design skills (possibly acquired from other commIT projects such as the training workshops and Cyberia Camp) and showcase it in a creative manner and style – thus the name CREATION which stands for Creative Competition.

### charITeach

NUSSU commIT strongly believes that knowledge is meant to be shared. Stemming from that belief, we initiated charITeach in April 2013. charITeach is an annual event that combines IT training and charity work, hence the name, providing the NUS community with an opportunity to learn and contribute to the society at the same time. charITeach aims to extend a helping hand to underprivileged children in Singapore through the teaching of IT skills using Scratch - a visual programming platform developed by MIT.

charITeach is a two-day event, consisting of Volunteer Training and Beneficiaries Invitation. During Volunteer Training, the volunteers will receive free Scratch training conducted by a professional training company, Code for Asia. This will equip the volunteers with the necessary skills. Then, during Beneficiaries Invitation, children from various beneficiaries around Singapore will be invited to the NUS campus for a fun introductory course to programming using Scratch conducted by the NUS volunteers. There will also be games and activities to facilitate bonding between the children and volunteers.

NUSSU commIT hopes that through this event, we can become the impetus, the catalyst to a knowledge-sharing community in NUS. charITeach is a meaningful project bound to provide both the participants and beneficiaries a fulfilling experience.
