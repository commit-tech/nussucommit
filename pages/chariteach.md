NUSSU commIT strongly believes that knowledge is meant to be shared. Stemming from that belief, we initiated charITeach in April 2013. charITeach is a combination of IT training and charity work, hence the name, providing the participants with an opportunity to learn and contribute to the society at the same time.

## What is charITeach?

charITeach aims to extend a helping hand to underprivileged children in Singapore through the teaching of IT skills. For the past 5 years, charITeach has been providing Adobe Photoshop training. However, starting from 2019, charITeach provides training for programming using Scratch - a visual programming platform developed by MIT. With the recent development in technology, computational thinking has become an increasingly important skill in today’s working world. It is definitely of great benefit that programming ideas are introduced to children at an early age.

## About charITeach 2020

charITeach 2020 is a two-day event, consisting of Volunteer Training on **Saturday, 21st March 2020** and Beneficiaries Invitation on **Saturday, 28th March 2020**.

During Volunteer Training, the volunteers will receive free Scratch training conducted by a professional training company, Code for Asia, in conjunction with the training division of NUSSU commIT. This event serves two purposes: to achieve NUSSU commIT’s aim of providing IT training to the NUS society, as well as to equip the volunteers with the necessary skills to help the beneficiaries during Beneficiaries Invitation.

During Beneficiaries Invitation, children from various beneficiaries around Singapore will be invited to the NUS campus for a fun introductory course to programming using Scratch conducted by the NUS volunteers. The course will last about 3 hours, with around 2 hours of training and 1 hour of challenge session, where children could develop their own game using Scratch. There will also be games and activities after, to facilitate bonding between the children and volunteers.

NUSSU commIT hopes that through this event, we can become the impetus, the catalyst to a knowledge-sharing community in NUS. charITeach is a meaningful project bound to provide both the participants and beneficiaries a fulfilling experience.

We invite passionate volunteers to join and contribute to the event. All students are welcome to apply regardless of prior experience or expertise.

**Registration is open until 21st February 2020**. To register to the event, please visit: <http://bit.ly/chariteach2020>
